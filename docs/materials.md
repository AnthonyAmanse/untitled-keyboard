# Bill of Materials

#### 1. PCBs (main pcb and blank top/bottom plates)

The kicad project is open source. You can print using the gerbers and send them to a PCB manufacterer. I used JLCPCB for my prototypes.

#### 2. Pair of Microcontrollers

I used a pair of BlueMicro840 from https://store.jpconstantineau.com/

You can also use a nice!nano or nrfmicro. They should already have board definitions in ZMK. You can also use a non-wireless pro micro for use with QMK instead. You can grab an Elite C from [MKUltra](https://mkultra.click/elite-c-v4/) or the cheaper pro micro with micro usb.

#### 3. 58 pcs of Diodes smd 1n4148w sod 123

You can grab some on ebay or amazon. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079KJX5J9) | [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/293687783598)
#### 4. 58 pcs of Kailh choc hot swap socket

I got some from MKUltra since I can buy the choc switches and MBK keycaps from them as well. [MKUltra](https://mkultra.click/kailh-hotswap-sockets)

#### 5. 2 pcs of 3.7v LiPo battery

You can find some on Ebay and Aliexpress. Make sure you get the ones that are 3mm thick. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/224159433635)
#### 6. 10 pcs of M2 7mm stand-offs/spacers

To fit a 3mm battery between the pcb and bottom plate, you should use 7mm spacers. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/174331139173)

#### 7. 20 pcs of M2 5mm screws 

5mm is tha maximum length you can use if you're using 7mm spacers. Take note that PCBs are 1.6mm thick [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/174466711363)

#### 8. 2 pcs of Momentary Tactile Pushbutton
